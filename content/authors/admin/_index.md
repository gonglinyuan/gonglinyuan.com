# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a pre-final year undergraduate student at the *Turing Class* (honored Class for computer science) of Peking University, China, advised by Prof. [Liwei Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VZHxoh8AAAAJ&hl=en). I had research experiences in self-supervised language pre-training, machine translation, ML for healthcare, and optimization algorithms. I am interested in developing practical machine learning algorithms. I am applying to Ph.D. in computer science for Fall 2020.
